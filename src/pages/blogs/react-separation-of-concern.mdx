When you’re building a React application, Often you’ll find yourself in a situation where you need to separate the UI and business logic. In this article, I will show you how to do that. This blog is mostly inspired from one of my [answer on stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69332889/reactjs-separation-of-ui-and-business-logic).

To explain this, I'll use a simple example of `counter`. We have a `Counter` component which has a button to increment and decrement the counter. The `Counter` component is responsible for rendering the UI, handling the click events and updating the counter value. This is the UI and business logic both in one component.

## Traditional way
```js
import { useState } from "react";
import numberWithCommas from "./helper";

const Counter = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(9999);

  const increaseCount = () => setCount(count + 1);
  const decreaseCount = () => setCount(count - 1);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>{numberWithCommas(count)}</p>
      <div>
        <button onClick={increaseCount}>Increase</button>
        <button onClick={decreaseCount}>Decrease</button>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};
```

The `numberWithCommas` function is a helper function which adds commas to the number. This is a pure function which takes a number and returns a string.

```js
const numberWithCommas = (x) => {
  return x.toString().replace(/\B(?=(\d{3})+(?!\d))/g, ",");
};
```
### Current Example

<iframe src="https://codesandbox.io/embed/react-counter-app-776jex?fontsize=14&theme=dark&view=split"
        style={{ width: "100%", height: "500px", border: "0", borderRadius: "4px", overflow: "hidden" }}
        title="React Counter App"
        allow="accelerometer; ambient-light-sensor; camera; encrypted-media; geolocation; gyroscope; hid; microphone; midi; payment; usb; vr; xr-spatial-tracking"
        sandbox="allow-forms allow-modals allow-popups allow-presentation allow-same-origin allow-scripts"
></iframe>

## Separation of Concern
Using, Separation of Concern, we can separate the UI and business logic. We can create a `Counter` component which is responsible for rendering the UI and a `useCounter` hook which is responsible for updating the counter value. The `Counter` component will use the `useCounter` hook to get the counter value and the functions to update the counter value.

### Counter Component
The component should only be responsible for rendering the UI. It should not be responsible for updating the counter value.

```js
import useCounter from "./useCounter";

const Counter = () => {
  const { count, increaseCount, decreaseCount } = useCounter();

  return (
    <div>
      <p>{count}</p>
      <div>
        <button onClick={increaseCount}>Increase</button>
        <button onClick={decreaseCount}>Decrease</button>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};
```

### useCounter Hook
The hook should only be responsible for handling all the business logic.

```js
import { useState } from "react";
import numberWithCommas from "./helper";

const useCounter = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(9999);

  const increaseCount = () => setCount(count + 1);
  const decreaseCount = () => setCount(count - 1);

  return {
    count: numberWithCommas(count),
    increaseCount,
    decreaseCount
  };
};
```
### Example with separation of concern

<iframe src="https://codesandbox.io/embed/react-separation-of-concern-3vxv1?fontsize=14&theme=dark&view=split"
        style={{ width: "100%", height: "500px", border: "0", borderRadius: "4px", overflow: "hidden" }}
        title="React Counter App"
        allow="accelerometer; ambient-light-sensor; camera; encrypted-media; geolocation; gyroscope; hid; microphone; midi; payment; usb; vr; xr-spatial-tracking"
        sandbox="allow-forms allow-modals allow-popups allow-presentation allow-same-origin allow-scripts"
></iframe>


## Conclusion
This approach should segregate the view and business logic. This will make the code more readable and maintainable.
